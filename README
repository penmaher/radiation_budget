Here is a brief summary of what the code does:

cre.py
    - find the area weighted global mean
    - some quick and dirty options for plotting area weighted values

global_mean.py
    - The class ComputeCloudRadiativeEffect has a method function to compute the 
      Cloud Radiative Effect (CRE)

rad_budget.py
    - The class AtmosEnergyBudget has two methods for computing the atmospheric
      energy budget. Option one is use the longwave cooling and shortwave
      absorption. Option two is to compute the total forcing using the cloud
      and clear sky forcing. See the blog link above for further details.
   -  This file still retains testing I was doing to validate the methods.
